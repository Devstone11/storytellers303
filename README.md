# storytellers303
The marketing website for the Storytellers a cappella group, at storytellers303.com.

The site is powered by GitHub Pages (https://docs.github.com/en/pages). 

To deploy to prod, simply push a change to the `main` branch of this repository. GitHub should have it deployed within minutes.

The domain is hosted on GoDaddy, in an account under the Storytellers email address. This is also where the DNS records are configured. GitHub has instructions around configuring the DNS [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site), and this article helped clarify some things: https://jinnabalu.medium.com/godaddy-domain-with-github-pages-62aed906d4ef.
